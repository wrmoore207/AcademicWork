We were able to retrieve Tides and Water Levels data from the NOAA web service. We pulled data for the Portland, Maine, USA station. Following is a graph that shows measured tidal water levels compared to predicted water levels over a one week period starting May 1, 2023. From this graph it is clear that tidal waters are measuring higher than expected.
