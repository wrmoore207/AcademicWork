# Story: 

Rising sea level is an increasing problem and one that affects
us locally. A rise in sea level by 1.6 feet could submerge 67%
of coastal sand dunes in Maine, increasing the risk of coastal
flooding and erosion. Locations, such as parts of Commercial 
Street, who are already suffering from tidal flooding will face
increased pressure. As time passes, you can see a difference 
between the observed rise in sea level and the predicted. 

 
# Objectives: 

We want to visualize the change in sea level over time 
compared to the predicted change. With that, we wish to show 
the difference between the actual change and the predicted. 
Using that data and a model created from the actual observed 
change, we will compare it with data showing how that new 
change in sea level will affect us locally in Portland.  

We want to be able to talk about the economic and 
infrastructural impact this change will have. This includes 
water treatment facilities on top of potential flooding in 
areas around Portland. 

We want to explore if storms have an impact to tidal water levels
